              <p>My best piece of advice for an interior design blog is to really know who you are trying to reach! Your style can evolve and change over time, and therefore, your readers will as well. However, you need to make sure that you are continuously answering your audience’s questions and solving their pain points! Dont be afraid to ask them what they need help with and what they want to hear about from you. Know who you are trying to reach and connect with them! A newsletter is a great way to get to know your readers!”</p>
